# This is a basic web crawler written using Anaconda which is a freemium open source python and R programming languages. I used urllib and beautiful soup. 
  I also made a test run of the end results of the script running. I ran the script on EVGA graphics cards on Newegg.com. If more variety of graphics cards 
  is wanted, then an if-else or try can catch will be necessary.
